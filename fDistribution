Python-Practice 4.10.1: Finding areas and percentiles.
To find the area under a chi-square distribution or the  at which the distribution has a given area, the chi2 object must be imported from the scipy.stats library. Next, the degrees of freedom and  are defined.

from scipy.stats import chi2

# Defines the degrees of freedom and chi-square_0
df = 7
x2 =  1.689
chi2.cdf can be used to calculate the area under the curve between  and .

# Calculates the area under the curve between 0 and chi-square_0
area = chi2.cdf(x2, df)

print(area)
0.02496315095256541
Conversely, if the area is defined, chi2.ppf gives the  value, or percentile, necessary to obtain that area.

# Defines an area under the curve

a = 0.025

# Calculates the percentile
perc = chi2.ppf(a, df)

print(perc)
1.6898691806773554
